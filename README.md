ðŸ’¼ Imagine you are working in the payroll department of a company. At the end of the year, the management decides to give employees a raise, but with different rules based on their current salaries:

Employees earning 50,000 or more will receive a 5% raise.

Employees earning less than 50,000 will receive a 7% raise.

To implement this policy, you use a SQL CASE statement that calculates the new salary for each employee directly in the query.
